      <span

class="ecrm-1440">job.</span>
      <!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ecrm-1440">Given that, there is a range of opinion on how many applications to send.</span>
      <span

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">they could conceivably qualify, which at a maximum might lead to as many</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">as 100 applications. Others cull the list. We </span><span 
class="ecti-1440">strongly encourage </span><span 
class="ecrm-1440">you</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">to apply to a minimum of 25 potential employers, by providing a</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">limited subsidy to photocopying of your job packet: Your first $x of</span>

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">Beyond $x you pay the usual photocopying cost per page, which should</span>
      <span

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">employer you apply to puts a burden on the staff, who must send out</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">multiple reference letters for each employer. So please do not apply to</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">zero-probability places. Also, this is the full extent of the subsidization; we</span>

class="ecrm-1440">circumstances (e.g. a student with a Fulbright that requires him to apply</span>

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">follows: The market decides who are the stars for the year, and those people</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">each get 25 offers. The 22 places that have no chance of hiring them (along</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">with the 3 who do have a chance) then wait for a month until they</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">learn the candidate has turned them down. They then make an</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">offer to one of the other stars, who has already accepted a job at</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">Harvard and also turns them down. Then, in March, they get realistic</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">and start making offers to people they might actually be able to</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">hire. So if you don&#8217;t have any job offers by Feb 15, don&#8217;t worry.</span>
