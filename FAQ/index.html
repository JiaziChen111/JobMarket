      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">accept under any circumstances, even if it were your only offer. If at the end</span>
      <span

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">you forfeit the right to any further help from us in finding another</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">job.</span>
      <!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ecrm-1440">Given that, there is a range of opinion on how many applications to send.</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">Some students basically apply to every employer advertising a job for which</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">they could conceivably qualify, which at a maximum might lead to as many</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">as 100 applications. Others cull the list. We </span><span 
class="ecti-1440">strongly encourage </span><span 
class="ecrm-1440">you</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">to apply to a minimum of 25 potential employers, by providing a</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">limited subsidy to photocopying of your job packet: Your first $x of</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">photocopies will be free, where the details of the policy can be found at</span>

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">Beyond $x you pay the usual photocopying cost per page, which should</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">encourage you to economize to some extent. Note that every extra</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">employer you apply to puts a burden on the staff, who must send out</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">multiple reference letters for each employer. So please do not apply to</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">zero-probability places. Also, this is the full extent of the subsidization; we</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">do not provide, for example, the envelopes in which you send out your</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">packets to employers.</span>

class="ecrm-1440">We have found that under these circumstances, most students apply to</span>
      <span

      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">circumstances (e.g. a student with a Fulbright that requires him to apply</span>
      <span 
class="ecrm-1440">only in Europe may have a much more restricted set of potential choices,</span>
