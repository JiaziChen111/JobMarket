<!--l. 382--><p class="indent" >  The Advice category is particularly noteworthy, as it contains (among other things) a
variety of documents specifically written by either JHU students or JHU faculty with their
personal advice about various aspects of the job market process. For example, the document
<span 
class="ectt-1200">AdviceMoffittInterviews.doc </span>contains advice Robert Moffitt has provided about how to
handle job market interviews.
<!--l. 395--><p class="indent" >  One of you (the students on the job market) should create an emailing list for you to email
each other with gossip, tips, useful urls that you discover, job listings that others might not
have seen, etc.
