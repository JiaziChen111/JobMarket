|                      |    | It MUST be LastnameFirstinitialMiddleinitial                                                                 |
|                      |    | e.g., Christopher D. Carroll it would be `CarrollCD`                                                         |
|                      |    | (We insist on the middle initial because some previous student may                                           |
|                      |    | have had the same last name and first initial that you have)                                                 |

|                      |    | To satisfy both of these rules, for example, Pierangelo De Pace’s moniker                                    |
|                      |    | was `DePacePA` (Angelo is the implicit middle name)                                                          |
|                      |    | Getting capitalization right is important - don’t be sloppy                                                  |
